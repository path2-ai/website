                            <p>1.1 Kern AI GmbH, Gerhart-Hauptmann-Allee 71, 15732 Eichwalde (“Licensor”) is a provider of digital solutions and offers a data-centric platform for Natural Language Products, Tools and Workflows. In these Terms, we refer to you as “Licensee”.</p>
                            <p>1.2 Licensor has developed the ecosystem “Kern AI” (hereinafter referred to as “Software”). Kern AI is a collection of tools to scale, analyze and mantain your natural language data. To do so, Kern AI provides the refinery as editor for natural language processing, bricks as a collection of modular and standardized code snippets that can be directly integrate into refinery, gates as online monitoring and inference API for data-centric models and workflow as orchestration layer for natural language-driven tasks.</p>
                            <p>1.3 Licensor offers both a self-hosted, on-premises version (“Self-hosted Edition”) and a hosted software as a service version (“SaaS Edition”) of Software.</p>
                            <p>1.4 Kern AI consists of a core (“Core”) and specific, proprietary software features as described in Annex 1. Licensor released the Core as an “Essential Open Source” version (“OSS Version”) under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (“Core License”). These Terms cover both, the Core and the Features, however, exclusively under the conditions of these Terms and not under the Core License. The use of the OSS Version free of charge is governed exclusively by the Core License and not subject to these Terms.</p>
                            <p>1.5 These Software License and Subscription Terms (“Terms”) provide the terms and conditions that govern both the commercial use of the Self-hosted Edition and the SaaS Edition and are to be included in a respective agreement between Licensor and Licensee.  </p>
                            <p>1.6 Unless Licensee already concluded an Agreement with Licensor that refers to these Terms, by installing the Self-hosted Edition or subscribing to the SaaS Edition, Licensee agrees to be bound by the following Terms.</p>
                        </div>

                            <p>2.1 Subject to the details set out in Annex 1, Licensor offers versions of both the Self-hosted Edition and the SaaS Edition that are free of charge for Licensee (“Free Versions”). The use of additional features not comprised by Free Versions and any granting an extended range of usage rights are subject to specific agreements or valid Subscriptions and the fees set out in Annex 1.</p>
                            <p>2.2 The scope of the different versions and editions of the Software is set out in Annex 1. For clarity, each version and edition of the Software may be limited to certain features and functionalities, a certain number of users (user-based system), a certain number of refinery credits, a certain subscription term, or a combination of the foregoing parameters.</p>
                            <p>2.3 The Parties may agree on further features not listed in Annex 1 on an individual basis. This may also include additional services such as programming, support, or similar services.</p>
                            <p>2.4 If required by applicable law, the parties will conclude an agreement on data processing.</p>
                            <p>2.5 The Licensee’s general terms and conditions shall only become part of a contract between the parties if this has been expressly agreed in text form (email being sufficient).</p>

                            <p>The provisions of this section 3 shall apply to the Self-hosted Edition only. Furthermore, for the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of this section 3 do not apply to the OSS Version.</p>
                            <h2 className="font-semibold">3.1 Grant of rights</h2>
                            <p>3.1.1 Licensor hereby grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-perpetual, and non-sublicensable right to use the Self-hosted Edition during the term of the respective agreement, subject to the provisions of such agreement and these Terms.

                            <p>3.1.2 The Self-hosted Edition will be made available to Licensor in source code form and any other form if described in Annex 1. For the provision of source code, the Parties agree that the provision of a link to a public or non-public repository is sufficient.</p>

                                <li>required for backup copies that shall ensure future use by Licensee.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>3.1.7 Licensee is not entitled to make the Self-hosted Edition available to third parties without prior explicit approval by the Licensor. This includes any sale, lease, letting, or indirect use of the Self-hosted Edition and its provision as a service.</p>
                            <p>3.1.8 In case Licensee is entitled to modify the Self-hosted Edition, unless agreed otherwise, the provisions of clause 3.1.7 also apply to any such modifications.</p>
                            <p>3.1.9 Furthermore, in case Licensee is entitled to modify the Self-hosted Edition, Licensee grants Licensor non-exclusive, sub-licensable, transferable, irrevocable rights of use, unlimited in time and space, to all modifications of the Self-hosted Edition, if any, and will provide Licensor upon request with the Source Code modified in the course of creating the modifications.</p>

                            <h2 className="font-semibold">3.2 Specific Obligations of Licensee</h2>
                            <p>3.2.1 Licensee is solely responsible for setting up a working hardware and software environment appropriate for the Software, also considering any additional load which may be caused to Licensee's IT environment by the Software, unless agreed otherwise.</p>
                            <p>3.2.2 Licensee shall follow the software installation and operating instructions provided by Licensor. Licensee is responsible for establishing the interfaces between the Software and further IT-environment of Licensee, unless agreed otherwise.</p>
                            <p>3.2.3 For any services and support provided by Licensor, Licensee must grant Licensor access to Licensee’s IT infrastructure required for the operation of the Software and to the respective installation of the Software directly or via remote access.</p>

                            <p>The provisions of this section 4 shall apply to the SaaS Edition only.</p>
                            <h2 className="font-semibold">4.1 Scope of Services</h2>
                            <p>4.1.1 Unless agreed otherwise and depending on the subscription plan chosen by Licensee, Licensor will provide the services set out in these Terms and in Annex 1.</p>
                            <p>4.1.2 Licensor shall make the SaaS Edition available to the Licensee via the Internet as software as a service during the term of the subscription contract.</p>
                            <p>4.1.3 The Licensor’s responsibility for the performance of the services ends at the WAN port of the router in the Licensor's data center (Ort der Leistungsübergabe). It is the Licensee’s sole duty to ensure that he can receive the Licensor’s service.</p>
                            <p>4.1.4 The Licensor is entitled, but under no obligation, to extend and further develop new features and functionalities of the SaaS Edition. The Licensor reserves the right to offer Licensee such new features and improvements against payment of an additional fee only. In the event of Licensee being provided with new features and improvements for a fee by means of a corresponding contractual agreement in addition to an existing contract, the provisions of such contract shall apply accordingly. In the event of Licensee being provided with new features and improvements free of charge, these new features and further improvements shall be deemed to be a voluntary service of the Licensor.</p>
                            <p>4.1.5 The Licensor may change the functional scope of the services at any time to an extent that is reasonable for the Licensee. Such change shall be deemed reasonable, in particular, if the services the parties expressly agreed on and the Licensor's main contractual performance obligations (Hauptleistungspflichten) remain substantially unchanged and if that change is necessary for an important reason. Such reasons are, without limitation, disruptions in the provision of services by subcontractors and safety reasons. If the changes do not exclusively concern new features and improvements or if the changes do not only concern insignificant components of the services to be provided by the Licensor, the Licensor shall notify the Licensee of the change by email at least four weeks before it comes into effect.</p>
                            <p>4.1.6 The Licensor is entitled to suspend the Licensee's access to the SaaS Edition if:</p>
                            <ul className="list-disc">
                                <li>there are indications that the Licensee's credentials for accessing the SaaS Edition have been or are being misused or that these credentials have been or are being provided to an unauthorised third party, or that credentials are being used by more than one person;</li>

                                <li>in the event of payment by direct debit, the Licensee has provided incorrect bank account details and does not effect the respective payment by other means.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>4.1.7 The Licensor shall announce the suspension of the Licensee’s credentials within the meaning of section 4.1.6 to the Licensee in text or written form at least one working day before the suspension comes into effect, insofar as, considering the interests of both parties, such announcement is reasonable does not affect the purpose of the suspension.</p>
                            <h2 className="font-semibold">4.2 Term and Termination</h2>
                            <p>4.2.1 A subscription shall become effective upon its activation by Licensor and shall remain valid unless terminated.</p>
                            <p>4.2.2 Either party may terminate a monthly subscription at least 30 days prior to its expiration, a monthly subscription shall be prolonged for further monthly periods respectively.</p>

                            <p>6.2 Licensee confirms to be aware of the essential functional features of the Software and solely bears the risk that it fits with Licensee's wishes and needs.

                            <p>6.3 Prior to any productive use of the Software as part of the respective contractual use, Licensee shall test the Software thoroughly to ensure that it is free of defects and that it is operable in the existing hardware and software environment of Licensee.

                            <p>6.4 Licensee shall take adequate precautions for the event that the Software does not work properly as a whole or partially.

                            <p>10.1 Unless stated otherwise in this Agreement, Licensor is liable in the event of a breach of contractual and non-contractual obligations in accordance with the statutory provisions.</p>
                            <p>10.2 To the extent any Software or functionality is provided free of charge, Licensor is liable only for intent and gross negligence (in accordance with statutory law).</p>
                            <p>10.3 To the extent the Software and Services (including access to the Software by means of Software as a Service) are provided for a fee, Licensor’s statutory liability is unlimited for intent and gross negligence as well as for injuries to life, limb or health. The same applies to claims related to provided guarantees (“Garantien”), applicable product liability laws or other legally mandatory grounds for liability.</p>
                            <p>10.4 Other than in the cases described in Sec. 10.3, Licensor is liable for slight negligence only in case of breach of a key contractual obligation (so called “cardinal obligation”), and limited to what was reasonably foreseeable in light of the given contractual setting in that case. A cardinal obligation in the sense of this section is an obligation whose fulfilment enables the execution of the Terms themselves and upon whose fulfilment Licensee may therefore generally rely.</p>
                            <p>10.5 In case of Sec. 10.4, Licensor is not liable for indirect damages and consequential damages like loss of earnings.</p>
                            <p>10.6 Furthermore, liability in case of Sec. 10.4 is limited to the remuneration payable by Licensee under these Terms projected for a twelve (12) month period.</p>
                            <p>10.7 The limitation of liability also applies respectively in favour of employees, agents, legal representatives, and assistants of Licensor.</p>
                            <p>10.8 Licensor is not liable to the extent that damages are caused by usage of the Software not in accordance with these Terms or modifications made by Licensee.</p>
                            <p>10.9 Licensor and the Software are not data backup providers. Licensee is responsible for regular backups of data which is processed using the Software. Therefore, to the extent Licensor is liable in principle under the foregoing for any loss of data, such liability is limited to the amount that would be needed to restore the lost data from a backup if it had been backed up properly beforehand.</p>

Licensee shall not unreasonably withhold the confirmation.</p>
                            <p>11.5 Any documentation provided with the Software may not be made publicly accessible by Licensee, unless agreed otherwise.</p>

Licensor will notify Licensee in text form (email being sufficient) about the modified terms before the modifications will enter into force and Licensor will inform Licensee about the new provisions, the planned date for the new terms to enter into effect, Licensee’s termination right, the applicable termination period and the significance of remaining silent, and Licensor will then grant an adequate, at least six-week period to Licensee to terminate the agreements that are based on these Terms if Licensee does not agree with the modified Terms. If Licensee does not terminate the agreements based on these Terms within the aforementioned period, the modified Terms shall apply upon expiration of the period. The termination by Licensee must be submitted in text form (email being sufficient).</p>
                            <p>12.3 Any provision of these Terms that is invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof. The parties shall replace any invalid or unenforceable provision by a valid or enforceable provision which most accurately reflects the initial purpose of the parties.</p>
                            <p>12.4 Unless expressly provided otherwise in these Terms, all notices hereunder shall be made in text form (email being sufficient).</p>

Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Potsdam, Germany.</p>
                            <p>12.7 The attached “Annex 1” is a part of these Terms. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the attached Annex 1, the provisions of Annex 1 shall prevail over the provisions of these Terms.  </p>
