# About our changelog

To us, a changelog is more than a bulletpoint list of features. We see it as part of the product, and want to commit to bringing you a changelog that gets you excited to try out new features.

We will collect every version here, trying to tell you little stories _why_ new features have been implemented. Often times, features will have an experimental characteristic, as we try out new ways to boost your creativity in implementing NLP applications.

Let us know what you think of the changelog, and tell us what you'd like to see next.
