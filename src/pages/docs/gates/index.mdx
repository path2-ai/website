gates simply is the add-on to refinery, allowing it to process realtime data streams. With gates, you can use refinery to make predictions on data immediately, and use the results to make operational decisions.

## Deploy

To deploy a model via gates, simply hit the 'Open config' button, which will open a modal that shows the automations of your synched refinery project.

Here, you can select which heuristics should be used for inference. They will be aggregated into a weakly supervised label during runtime, but you will also have the single votes for indication during inference.

## Inference

If you now want to call the model, you can either use the embedded playground to test the inference, or you can integrate the model by copy-pasting the displayed code snippet. For Python, this looks as follows:

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:4455/commercial/predict/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID"

headers = {
    "accept": "application/json",
    "content-type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "YOUR_PROJECT_ID YOUR_API_KEY"
}

# replace with your own example data
example_data = {
  "running_id": 1,
  "text": "what do i need to do to apply for a visa card"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=example_data)

print(response.text)
```

## Monitoring

Each project comes with a minimal monitoring dashboard, which shows you the essential metrics for operations. These are:

- `Requests per hour`: how often is your model called?
- `Confidence`: how confident is your model during inference?
- `Response time`: how long does it take your model to do inference?

## Container

Every gates model is deployed in a dedicated Docker container. If you want to run the model on your own premises instead of our hosted cloud, we can export the image and transfer it to you.
