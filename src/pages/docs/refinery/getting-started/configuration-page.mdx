# Configuration page

When you're in the locally hosted application, you will realize that there are some configurations you can adapt. These include the available tokenizers and some boundaries for your project sizes, which we pre-configured based on our experiences with the application.

To change the configurations, head to the avatar icon and click on "Change config".

You'll then see a page with some key-value pairs, which you can adapt as you like. The spaCy language models are available for new projects as you add them to this configuration.
