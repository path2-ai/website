# Self-hosted version

Kern refinery is available as [open-source](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery), such that you can just install it on your local machine. The open-source version doesn't contain user management.

If you enjoy working with it, please consider giving us a [GitHub star ‚≠ê](https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery).

You can install the application via cloning our repository or via pip.

**Repository**:

```
git clone https://github.com/code-kern-ai/refinery.git
```

If you are on Mac/Linux:

```
./start
```

If you are on Windows:

```
start.bat
```

To stop the application, run `./stop` (Mac/Linux) or `stop.bat` (Windows).

**Pip**:

```
pip install kern-refinery
```

Once you've installed the app, run `refinery start`, which will pull the services and connects them. To stop the app, run `refinery stop`.

Now, you can go to `localhost:4455`, where you will see - after registering a user - the following screen:

From here, you can start by creating a project. We recommend trying the [quick start](doc:quickstart) of this documentation.
