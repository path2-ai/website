# Managing roles

If you want to work with multiple users, you can easily do so by adding further users to your organization

There are three roles:

- **Engineers**: Administer the project and works on programmatic tasks such as labeling automation or filter settings. They have access to all features of the application, including the Python SDK.
- **Domain experts**: Working on reference manual labels, which can be used by the engineering team to estimate the data quality. They have access to the labeling view only.
- **Annotator**: Working on manual labels as if they were heuristics. They can be switched on/off by the engineering team so that the engineers can in- or exclude them during weak supervision. They have access to a task-minimized labeling view only. Engineers can revoke their access to the labeling view.

To invite one of these roles, simply contact your support manager. We will quickly invite the new users for you and set up the roles.
