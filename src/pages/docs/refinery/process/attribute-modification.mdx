# Attribute modification

If you realize that you want to add some further attributes to your record, you ca easily do so. Imagine for instance that you want to compute the lower text version of a headline:

The interface is identical to one of a labeling function with the exception that you don't return a label, but instead the attribute you want to calculate. Use this e.g. for things such as:

- calculating the language of a text
- calculating the complexity of a sentence
- checking if the grammar is set correctly
- and many further examples.

We are currently implementing a content library, which will help you identify relevant attribute enrichments for your records. Stay tuned :)
