# Comments

Especially when you're working with multiple people in one project, comments become super helpful to better communicate in an asynchronous approach thought e.g. during labeling. This is now available, and you can create comments anywhere inside a project by clicking on the comments icon in the upper navbar (next to the navigation center).

This will open a sidebar, where you can see existing comments made by your colleagues. These are bound to project entities such as labeling tasks, data slices, or even on record level. Comments are highly valuable e.g. if you want to set up a crowd labeling heuristic and want to help your annotators understand a labeling task.
