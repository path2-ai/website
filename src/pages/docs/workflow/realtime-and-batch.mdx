# Realtime and batch-processing

In workflow, you can define two types of processess: realtime (i.e. operational) and batch (i.e. analytical) workflows. They differ in a very simple way:

- realtime jobs are executed per item, and can be executed e.g. every second
- batch jobs technically also work on item-level, but they are executed on batches of data, and can be executed e.g. every day. This higher level of granularity makes them perfect for analytical jobs.

To define a workflow (no matter which type), simply hit `New project`, and click on one of the two options to either start from scratch or by using a template.

If you start from scratch, you can now define which type of workflow you want to build.
